# Extracting original graphics, sounds, video, maps and musics

Warning: Resinstaller will overwrite existing graphics. If you want to
keep existing free graphics for some reasons *backup* the folders fx,
gfx, vehicles and buildings. It's save to copy the files back after the
resinstaller has done it's magic.


The tool can be found on our website and easily installs and converts
the needed data for you. Please check the bbs at maxr.org for more
informations. When using the windows installer for maxr, the resinstaller
is also installed, and a Start Menu shortcut is available.
