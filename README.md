## Supported Platforms

* Mac OS X ![Mac-OS-badge](https://github.com/MAX-Reloaded/maxr/actions/workflows/macos.yml/badge.svg)
* MS Windows ![Premake5-windows-badge](https://github.com/MAX-Reloaded/maxr/actions/workflows/premake5-windows.yml/badge.svg)
* Linux ![Ubuntu-badge](https://github.com/MAX-Reloaded/maxr/actions/workflows/ubuntu.yml/badge.svg)

Other UNIX-like operating systems may work too out of the box. Chances are huge if there's a build of SDL2 and CMake for the system.
